<p>Joseph Hall has been a professional software developer for more than 30 years. He has worked as a programmer for Microsoft, IBM, and Thoughtworks; he was the software architect for a Fortune 500 bank; he was the CTO of an online ticket sales and servicing company; and he started his own consulting companies in 2006 (Codetopia, LLC, AL) and 2015 (Ososoft, LLC, GA).</p>

<p>Joe makes his living writing desktop, web, and mobile device applications for businesses and governmental agencies, but game programming is his passion, and it was gaming that got him into programming in the first place. He was a member of the original Xbox team and he joined the Visual Studio .NET team just after the Xbox was released in 2001.</p>

<p>He is the author of <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1JuxvD8" target="_blank">XNA Game Studio Express: Developing Games for Windows and the Xbox 360</a></em>, which was published in 2007, and <em>Fauxcabulary: Fake Definitions, Real Funny</em>, which was self-published in 2015 (for <a href="https://leanpub.com/fauxcabulary" target="_blank">eBook</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/joseph-hall/fauxcabulary/paperback/product-22179468.html" target="_blank">print</a>). He has several new books in the pipeline including a multi-volume series on MonoGame development using Xamarin Studio and a techno-thriller trilogy set in the not-so-distant future.</p>

<p>Today, Joe lives with his wife and three daughters in Newnan, Georgia. Every summer, from 2011 through 2018, Joe taught high school students how to write video games during an intense weeklong course in North Carolina for Landry Academy. In his free time, Joe dabbles in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When you see his artistic creations, you’ll understand why he makes his living as a programmer.</p>

<p>In 2015, I moved my family to Newnan, Georgia, for a job with (arguably) the most rabid advocates for agile methodolgies, test-driven development, and pair programming — Thoughtworks, Inc. At that time, it was easier to let my Alabama LLC lapse and start a new company than to transfer the entity to Georgia. Ososoft is the vehicle by which I do all my contract work these days.</p>

<p>I loved my first stint with Thoughtworks in 2015, but I didn’t love the 100% travel. When they contacted me to return to a 100% remote culture, I jumped at the chance. Of all the places I’ve worked, I’ve never learned more than I have during my time with this company. Under their umbrella, I wrote apps in Java, .NET, JavaScript, and Microsoft technologies specifically tailored to the development of chatbots including their brand of NLP, LLM, and OpenAI; and later to include MSFT’s Dynamics 365 CRM.</p>

<p>At the AL Department of Education, my team was brought in to implement a system for processing the issuance and renewal of teaching certificates. The process was paper-based and it could take as much as 9 months to get a certificate issued or renewed. We were able to radically rework their process, distribute the work load to the field agents, and automate the workflows so that the 9-month process could be completed in around 5 minutes. From application, to payment, to digital issuance of the certificates — Certification Specialists were able to focus their time on exceptional cases (like failed background checks, or missing continuing education credits).</p>

They were building a business to fill in the gaps left by giants in the area of ticket sales and servicing. Think TicketMaster, EventBright, LiveNation, … but at a much smaller scale. I managed a small team of developers and made the architectural decisions for new tech. I also got to keep my hands in the code, which has always been a requirement of mine.</p>

<p>I was using Java since the time it was in beta, so I was a great fit for the Visual J++ team at Microsoft. In those days, MSFT was pushing the concept of managed code, rooted in the Java language. Then the Sun lawsuit hit and MSFT decided to pivot to creating their own managed code tools and languages. I was using C# before it was released to the general public. In fact, I trained the  Java developers on migrating to C#. Shortly thereafter, I landed my dream job — as a Programmer/Writer on the original Xbox team. Once the  console launched, I moved over to the Visual Studio .NET team, as an SDET on the performance team.</p>

<p>I was the senior developer on a for-profit arm of the university that was combining tech with their amazing group of content creators to make a CBT for high school and college-level Mathematics concepts.</p>

<p>My first professional programming gig found me working on applications that were much older than me. COBOL was the language of the job, but I was able to create several apps (including one for inventory management) in Pascal, backed by DBase.</p>

<p>With a bit of professional experience in programming, and a new job at the U of A, I made the trek to Tuscaloosa to major in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. It was here that I met and married my much, much better half. After four years of college, I kept getting better and better jobs. I did not graduate.</p>

<p>I graduated high school in 1990. I never planned to go to college. My parents didn’t. Their parents didn’t. But, I was able to land a music scholarship that would take me through my first two weeks as a Music major. I didn’t really want to be a performer or a director, but I was pretty good at playing the trombone and baritone. Once on campus, I was offered a Math scholarship, so I immediately switched majors and selected Computer Science as my minor. In the first two years, I completed the senior level courses in the CS department and found that I had a passion for it. I moved on to the University of Alabama to major in CS and minor in Math. I did not graduate.</p>

<p>At one point, I wanted to be a trainer of software developers in the corporate space. I obtained all my certifications through the MCT, but never actually taught a course. I did, however lead the training for several of my programming gigs, and I taught high school students how to program video games for several summers between 2011 and 2018.</p>
