Robin O'Bryant is a writer and stay-at-home-mom to three daughters born within four years. She finally figured out where babies come from and got herself under control.

Robin survives the hilarity of motherhood by making fun of herself in her books [Ketchup is a Vegetable](https://www.amazon.com/Ketchup-Vegetable-Other-Lies-Themselves/dp/1250054141) and forth-coming _Are You There God? It's Me, Mommy_, in self-syndicated humor column, "Robin's Chicks," and on her blog by the same name.

Visit her site and learn to: breastfeed behind your back, talk to your daughters about man parts, and write a gold fish obituary. Robin tweets compulsively and over shares daily on Facebook as Robin Wiley O'Bryant. Come point and laugh.
